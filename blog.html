                <p><span class="font-bold">Global scope:</span> Variables declared outside of any function have global
                    scope. They can be accessed from anywhere in the code. <br>
                    <span class="font-bold">Function scope:</span> Variables declared inside a function have function
                    scope. They can only be accessed from within the function that they are declared in. <br>
                    <span class="font-bold">Block scope:</span> Variables declared in a block (such as a if statement or
                    a for loop) have block scope. They can only be accessed from within the block that they are declared
                    in.
                    The keywords var, let, and const are used to declare variables in JavaScript. The scope of a
                    variable declared with each keyword is different. <br>

                    <span class="font-bold">var:</span> Variables declared with the var keyword have function scope.
                    This is the default scope in JavaScript. <br>
                    <span class="font-bold">let:</span> Variables declared with the let keyword have block scope. <br>
                    <span class="font-bold">const:</span> Variables declared with the const keyword also have block
                    scope, but they cannot be reassigned once they are initialized.

                <p><span class="font-bold">Null</span> is used to explicitly represent the absence of a value. For
                    example, you might use null to
                    represent a user that has not logged in, or a product that is not in stock. <br>
                    <span class="font-bold">Undefined</span> is used to represent the absence of a value that has not
                    been explicitly assigned. For
                    example, the value of a variable that has not been initialized is undefined.
                    Here are some of the use cases of null and undefined <br><br>

                    *You can use the === operator to compare a value to null or undefined.

                <p><span class="font-bold">REST API</span> stands for Representational State Transfer Application
                    Programming Interface. It is an architectural style for designing APIs (Application Programming
                    Interfaces) that allows for interaction between systems. REST APIs are based on the HTTP protocol
                    and use standard HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources.
